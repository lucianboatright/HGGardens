# Project Outline 
Simple website for Hugo Boatright Gardening and Landscapes.
The project was to build a simple React web page to both allow clients to contact HGgardens and showcase HBgardening's previous projects and work.
The tech stack was built on a React (cra) base with several packages to help with different actions and animations. I used this project to test several variations on the same package to find the most useful and see the differences on the package offered.

## Tech-stack 
The project was build on a Create-react-app base 
I have included several packages to aid with the management of images 
These were brought into the project using components allowing for rapid integration and testing. 

Packages:
- Material-UI - Used to build grids in the Services component. Grid - Paper - Typography - ButtonBasegit a
- Helmet - Label tabs in webpage
- React-carosel: Forms images into carousel 
- React-image-gallary: Manipulate images
- React-elastic-carousel: Used to try to put images into carousel but had restrictions.
- React-router-dom: Used to link pages together
- Bootstrap: Used for CSS and styling management
- FlexBox: Creates grids on page to allow specific placement.
- React-grid-system: similar to Flex box but less flexible.
- React animations: Hover 

Styling has been implemented in several fashions to allow for learning and practice of implementation.
CSS Styling using:
    React css Modules - controls the scope of the css file
    MaterialUI / useStyles - Create const outside component that can be referenced in line as className={classes.part}
    Inline CSS - used on specific parts to either override or easy of interpolation. 

## Project goals 
There were several technologies that both the client and I were interesting in using. 
    Making active sections - onHover / onClick actions
    Image carousels - show range of images on carousel
    Active links - Facebook links, RHS and logo links
