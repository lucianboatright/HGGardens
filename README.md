# Project Outline 
Simple website for Hugo Boatright Gardening and Landscapes.
The porject was to build a simple React web page to both allow clients to contact HGgardens and showcase HBgardening's previous projects and work.
The tech stack was built on a React (cra) base with several packages to help with different aspects. 


## Tech-stack 
The project was build on a Create-react-app base 
I have included several packages to aid with the managment of images 
These were brought into the project using components allowing for rapid intergration and testing. 

Packages:
    React-multi-carousel
    Material-UI - Used to build grids in the Services component. Grid - Paper - Typography - ButtonBase
    react-router-dom - Used to Link all pages together
    Helmet - Lable tabs in webpage

Styling has been implimented in several fashions to allow for learing and practice of implimentation.
CSS Styling using:
    React css Modules - controles the scope of the css file
    MaterialUI / useStyles - Create const outside component that can be referanced in line as className={classes.part}
    Inline CSS - used on specific parts to either overide or easy of interpilation. 

## Project goals 
There were several technologies that both the client and I were interesting in using. 
    Making active sections - onHover / onClick actions
    Image carosels - show range of images on carosel
    Active links - Facebook links, RHS and logo links
